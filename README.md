1. Overview 
===========

Source Code of the Project I did for my University BSc Computer Games Programming course for my module Web Development.
We were tasked with creating a Web Application of our choosing which must make use of HTML5 technologies and contain a 
Web Service. The Application must also make use of a Database.

The Web Application I developed is a small Web Game created with ASP.NET specifically ASP Web Pages and uses WebGL to 
produce a 3D image. Individuals would play the game resulting in data being pushed into a relational Database. The Database
would then be queried in order to produce a report and graphs about several properties of the data including comparisons 
between incorrect and correct scores etc.
